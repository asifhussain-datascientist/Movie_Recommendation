# Movie Recommendation
This repository contains the implementation of a simple Content-Based Movie Recommendation System. The system uses CountVectorizer and Cosine Similarity to recommend movies based on textual features such as movie descriptions, genres, and other relevant information.

# Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a content-based recommendation system. The system works by comparing the textual features of movies and recommending similar movies based on the computed similarity scores. We use a combination of CountVectorizer for feature extraction and Cosine Similarity for determining the similarity between movies.

# Features
* **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to a given movie based on its features.
* **Text Vectorization**: Uses CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical feature vectors.
* **Similarity Calculation:** Uses Cosine Similarity to find the most similar movies.
* **Scalable**: Can handle small to moderately large datasets efficiently.

# Installation
* Clone the repository.
* Install the required dependencies.
* Launch Jupyter Notebook.
* Open the notebook file and run the cells.

# Usage
* Prepare the dataset. Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format with features such as movie titles, genres, descriptions, or keywords.
* Run the model by executing the cells in the Jupyter Notebook.
* Get recommendations by inputting the name of a movie, and the system will return a list of similar movies.

# Dataset
**The dataset for this project should contain relevant features such as:**

* **Movie Title:** The name of the movie.
* **Combined Features:** A string that combines various features like genre, description, etc., to form the textual data.

# Model Description
* **CountVectorizer:** Converts the combined text features into a matrix of token counts (Bag of Words).
* **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates the similarity between two vectors (movies) by measuring the cosine of the angle between them.
